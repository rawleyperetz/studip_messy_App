# studip_messy_App
I keep having to open studip website and fill in my information. Apparently because I am student which of course is mundane. I am not referring to the student bit.
Okay, this is a playful code that can be adjusted to suit your needs for other website.
Also, I would like to give a shoutout to all front-end designers, 'cause drawing a form with just powershell script was tedious.
Anyways, I hope you like it and if you clone or copy this work and it does not run on your pc, just remember the Developer's nightmare "But it run on Rawley's computer, why not mine". Danke
